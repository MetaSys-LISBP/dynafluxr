Description: Reaction rate dynamics can be retrieved from time-series measurements
  of chemical species and/or their isotopes. User has to provide
  corresponding stoechiometric
  matrix but not a regulation model (Michaelis-Menten or similar).
  Instead of solving an ODE system describing the evolution of concentrations,
  we use B-splines to catch the concentration and rate dynamics then
  solve a least square problem on their coefficients with positivity
  (and optionaly monotonicity) constraints.
  Constraints can be also set on initial values of concentration.
  The package 'dynafluxr' can be used as a library but also as
  an application with command line interface.
