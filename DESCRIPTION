Title: Retrive Flux Dynamics from Metabolic Kinetic Measurements

Description: Flux dynamics can be retrieved from kinetic measurements
  of metabolites and/or their isotopes. User has to provide
  corresponding stoechiometric
  matrix but not a regulation model (Michaelis-Menten or similar).
  Instead of solving an ODE system describing the evolution of metabolite concentrations,
  we use B-splines to catch the system dynamics and solve a least square problem
  on their coefficients with optional constraints on initial values of concentration.
  The package 'dynafluxr' can be used as a library providing useful functions but also as
  an application with command line interface.
