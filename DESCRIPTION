Description: Reaction rate dynamics can be retrieved from metabolite
  concentration time courses. User has to provide corresponding stoichiometric
  matrix but not a regulation model (Michaelis-Menten or similar).
  Instead of solving an ODE system describing the evolution of concentrations,
  we use B-splines to catch the concentration and rate dynamics then
  solve a least square problem on their coefficients with non-negativity
  (and optionally monotonicity) constraints.
  Constraints can be also set on initial values of concentration.
  The package 'dynafluxr' can be used as a library but also as
  an application with command line interface 'dynafluxr::cli("-h")' or graphical user interface 'dynafluxr::gui()'.
